# Overview
Bitcoin DX (BCDX) is an open source cryptocurrency on it’s own independent blockchain. It is a hard-fork of Bitcoin Core 0.22 and built to be feature-rich, reliable and secure.

Source code has been generalized, allowing forking without too much hassle. Simply adjust your parameters in chainparams.cpp, amount.h and validation.cpp before you fire away.

# Economic Sustainability
8,400,000,000 BCDX have been pre-mined in order to curb immediate demand, which means 60% of max volume can be mined.

The algorithm used to form a homogeneous economy is this:
MINE_REWARDS = MAX_VOLUME - PRE_MINE.
24_HOURS*6_BLOCKS_HOURLY = 144 blocks per day * 365 = 52560 blocks per annum * 59931 BCDX = 3,149,973,360 BCDX mining rewards per annum / 2 yearly halving interval ongoing.

This formulae is very desirable for blockchain miners as it will incentivize reward payouts for up to 80 years, reaching target volume cap.
